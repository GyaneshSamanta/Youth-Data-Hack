# ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

Analyze a public dataset to gain insights into a social, environmental, or economic issue and develop a data driven solution.

# ðŸ§  Knowledge Primer

### Dataset
The analysis is based on the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) dataset. The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, revealing insights into various aspects of shooting incidents.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA includes the use of Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium for visualization and geospatial analysis.

### Key Visualizations
1. **Shootings by Borough:**
   - Bar chart illustrating the number of shootings in each borough.

2. **Shootings Over Time:**
   - Line chart depicting the trend of shootings over time on a monthly basis.

3. **Perpetrator Age Group Distribution:**
   - Bar chart showing the distribution of shootings based on perpetrator age groups.

4. **Perpetrator Gender and Race Distribution:**
   - Stacked bar charts illustrating the distribution of shootings based on perpetrator gender and race.

5. **Victim Age, Gender and Race Distributions:**
   - Stacked bar charts showing the distribution of shootings based on victim age, gender and race.

6. **Shootings Resulting in Murder:**
   - Pie chart indicating the proportion of shootings resulting in murder.

7. **Geospatial Analysis:**
   - Folium map with a heatmap indicating the locations of shooting incidents.

8. **Cross-tabulations:**
   - Tables showing relationships between variables such as perpetrator race vs. victim race, perpetrator age group vs. victim age group and perpetrator gender vs. victim gender.

9. **Additional Analysis:**
   - Various charts analyzing shootings by time of day, day of the week and top precincts.

### Clustering Analysis
The knowledge primer concludes with a clustering analysis using K-Means clustering. The analysis explores patterns based on precinct, location, time of day and day of the week.
